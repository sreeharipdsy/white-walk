                Description: <br>
                The image features a sleek, [Model Name of Shoe] with a futuristic design. The sneaker is predominantly black with intricate textures and details, giving it a high-tech appearance.
                The background is a gradient of deep blue and purple hues, creating a sense of depth and an otherworldly atmosphere. There are subtle, flowing shapes or wisps of smoke in the background, enhancing the futuristic and energetic vibe.
                The scene includes scattered rocks in purple tones, adding to the overall aesthetic without distracting from the focal pointâ€”the sneaker. <br>
                Mood and Tone: <br>
                The image should evoke a sense of innovation, speed, and cutting-edge technology. It should feel both dynamic and sophisticated, appealing to a modern, tech-savvy audience.
                The glowing neon lights and the deep, rich colors contribute to a futuristic, almost sci-fi atmosphere. <br>
                Usage: <br>
                This image is intended to be used as the background for the hero section of a website. It should draw immediate attention and set the tone for the rest of the site.
                Ensure that the main content (headlines, buttons, etc.) placed on top of this background remains legible and visually appealing. Consider using contrasting colors for text and other elements to stand out against the vibrant and busy background. <br>
                Specifications: <br>
                The image should be high resolution to maintain quality across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
                Ensure the composition allows for flexibility in positioning text and other elements, avoiding key details of the sneaker being obscured.
