            <h4>Background Images Prompt:</h4>
            <p>
                Description: <br>
                The image features a sleek, [Model Name of Shoe] with a futuristic design. The sneaker is predominantly
                black with intricate textures and details, giving it a high-tech appearance.
                The background is a gradient of deep blue and purple hues, creating a sense of depth and an otherworldly
                atmosphere. There are subtle, flowing shapes or wisps of smoke in the background, enhancing the
                futuristic and energetic vibe.
                The scene includes scattered rocks in purple tones, adding to the overall aesthetic without distracting
                from the focal pointâ€”the sneaker. <br>
                Mood and Tone: <br>
                The image should evoke a sense of innovation, speed, and cutting-edge technology. It should feel both
                dynamic and sophisticated, appealing to a modern, tech-savvy audience.
                The glowing neon lights and the deep, rich colors contribute to a futuristic, almost sci-fi atmosphere.
                <br>
                Usage: <br>
                This image is intended to be used as the background for the hero section of a website. It should draw
                immediate attention and set the tone for the rest of the site.
                Ensure that the main content (headlines, buttons, etc.) placed on top of this background remains legible
                and visually appealing. Consider using contrasting colors for text and other elements to stand out
                against the vibrant and busy background. <br>
                Specifications: <br>
                The image should be high resolution to maintain quality across various screen sizes, from desktops to
                mobile devices.
                Ensure the composition allows for flexibility in positioning text and other elements, avoiding key
                details of the sneaker being obscured.

            <h4>Prompt for Background Image:</h4>
            <p>
                Create a minimalistic, abstract background with smooth gradients and subtle textures. Use a color
                palette that complements the hero section's vibrant and dynamic hues, featuring soft purples, blues, and
                hints of neon accents. Ensure the background is clean and unobtrusive, providing a seamless transition
                from the hero section while maintaining a cohesive visual theme. The design should evoke a sense of
                modernity and sophistication, without drawing attention away from the content that will be placed over
                it. please don't include any texts or elements
