            <p>
                Description: <br>
                The image features a sleek, [Model Name of Shoe] with a futuristic design. The sneaker is predominantly black with intricate textures and details, giving it a high-tech appearance.
                The background is a gradient of deep blue and purple hues, creating a sense of depth and an otherworldly atmosphere. There are subtle, flowing shapes or wisps of smoke in the background, enhancing the futuristic and energetic vibe.
                The scene includes scattered rocks in purple tones, adding to the overall aesthetic without distracting from the focal point—the sneaker. <br>
                Mood and Tone: <br>
                The image should evoke a sense of innovation, speed, and cutting-edge technology. It should feel both dynamic and sophisticated, appealing to a modern, tech-savvy audience.
                The glowing neon lights and the deep, rich colors contribute to a futuristic, almost sci-fi atmosphere. <br>
                Usage: <br>
                This image is intended to be used as the background for the hero section of a website. It should draw immediate attention and set the tone for the rest of the site.
                Ensure that the main content (headlines, buttons, etc.) placed on top of this background remains legible and visually appealing. Consider using contrasting colors for text and other elements to stand out against the vibrant and busy background. <br>
                Specifications: <br>
                The image should be high resolution to maintain quality across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
                Ensure the composition allows for flexibility in positioning text and other elements, avoiding key details of the sneaker being obscured.

                Create a minimalistic, abstract background with smooth gradients and subtle textures. Use a color palette that complements the hero section's vibrant and dynamic hues, featuring soft purples, blues, and hints of neon accents. Ensure the background is clean and unobtrusive, providing a seamless transition from the hero section while maintaining a cohesive visual theme. The design should evoke a sense of modernity and sophistication, without drawing attention away from the content that will be placed over it. please don't include any texts or elements

            <h3><span>3</span>SHOP PAGE | SHOP SECTION</h3>
            <h4>Add to Cart, Checkout</h4>
            <p>
                I need to write a JavaScript code to display products as card items on a webpage. Each product card should include the product name, product image, description, an "Add to Cart" button to add the product to the cart, and a product count with "plus" and "minus" buttons on either side to add or remove products from the cart with transitions. When clicking on a product card, it should open a dynamically generated page with a "Back to Shop" option, product image, description, details, an "Add to Cart" button to add the product to the cart, and a "Checkout" button to check out the opened product via WhatsApp with transitions.

                Here are the detailed steps and requirements:
                
                1. **Display product cards on the main page with:**
                   - Product name
                   - Product image
                   - Product description
                   - "Add to Cart" button to add the product to the cart
                   - Product count with "plus" and "minus" buttons on either side to add or remove products from the cart with transitions.
                   
                2. **When clicking on a product card, navigate to a dynamically generated product details page that includes:**
                   - A "Back to Shop" option which goes back to shop page
                   - Product image
                   - Product description
                   - Product details
                   - "Add to Cart" button to add the product to the cart
                   - "Checkout" button to check out the opened product via WhatsApp with transitions.
                   
                3. **Update the cart count in the navbar dynamically when products are added or removed from the cart with smooth transitions.**
                
                4. **When clicking on the cart icon in the navbar, open a modal that includes:**
                   - A list of products added to the cart with:
                     - Product image
                     - Product name
                     - "plus" and "minus" buttons on either side of the product count to add or remove products from the cart with transitions.
                   - A "Checkout" button at the bottom of the modal that:
                     - Redirects to WhatsApp with the list of products added to the cart.
                     - Is disabled if there are no products in the cart, instead showing "No items in cart".
                   - Smooth transitions for opening and closing the modal and for updating product counts.
                
                Here’s an example structure of the products array you can use to generate the product cards dynamically:
                ```javascript
                const products = [
                  { id: 1, name: "Product 1", description: "Description 1", image: "image1.jpg", details: "Details 1" },
                  { id: 2, name: "Product 2", description: "Description 2", image: "image2.jpg", details: "Details 2" },
                  // Add more products as needed
                ];
                ```
                
                Generate the JavaScript code to implement this functionality, ensuring it includes smooth transitions and dynamic updates as specified.
